# Neural Magic + Roboflow

This example shows how to integrate Neural Magic's SparseML training toolkit and DeepSparse inference runtime with Roboflow's Dataset and Annotate products to enable continual learning in a YOLOv5 deployment.

## What Is Continual Learning?

Full Stack Deep Learning has an [awesome lecture](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/course/2022/lecture-6-continual-learning/) on the 
importance of setting up a Continual Learning system to ensure your deep learning models are performing correctly in production.
